&lt;p&gt;Have you registered as a Dbljump editor yet? If you have, you might have noticed a few missing features at our user settings site &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.dbljump.com&quot;&gt;id.dbljump.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news - we just added a raft of features that you probably expected to be there already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded .webm videos.
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;One of our new user profile controls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upload, change, and remove your profile picture&lt;/strong&gt; - feel like you’re in the future yet?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set your location and gender&lt;/strong&gt; - choose binary options or type whatever you want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be taken back to the page you clicked ‘Log in’ from&lt;/strong&gt; - automatically as if by magic!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a new login email&lt;/strong&gt; - you’ll be asked to confirm it before you can start using it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run into any bugs, problems, or just want to let us know what you think, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;tweet us&lt;/a&gt; or talk to us via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;our Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021/08/zelda-article.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deployed a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.dbljump.com/&quot;&gt;the Dbljump public reference&lt;/a&gt; last week, which brings lots of fixes and improvements - and takes us another step closer towards achieving &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.dbljump.com/&quot;&gt;our mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump wasn’t Showtime-Ready when we first launched a few months ago, and it isn’t now. But that’s ok. Our current phase is about trying things out in production, sharing what we’re working on, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.dbljump.com/register&quot;&gt;inviting you to get involved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve rewritten a LOT of the dbljump.com reference, but here are some of the most noticeable improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game release dates work.&lt;/strong&gt; They now display correctly in the article header. The earliest release place is shown in the versions table. And you get a comprehensive list of dates, places, and platforms in the details section of each game article.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We split the site in two.&lt;/strong&gt; The public reference and content editing tools now have separate homes at alpha.dbljump.com and editor.dbljump.com. This has made the public reference application much smaller and simpler, which means it loads faster. Separating concerns like this means we can work towards much more focused designs for each site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can now read from the top.&lt;/strong&gt; When you click through to a new page, you start at the top - not at the previous page’s scroll position like before.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata lists work.&lt;/strong&gt; We fixed problems with abbreviated lists like “Action, RPG, Fantasy, +3 more”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;404 errors work everywhere now.&lt;/strong&gt; You would previously get a blank screen when visiting a URL like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://alpha.dbljump.com/people/bad-link&lt;/code&gt;. Now you get helpful feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to see these changes in action, check out some of our more complete articles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.dbljump.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&quot;&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.dbljump.com/games/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection&quot;&gt;Ghosts ‘n Goblins Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.dbljump.com/register&quot;&gt;why not sign up and create your own&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d love to know what you think of our progress so far. What do you like? Where are we totally failing? Tell us via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be reading your messages - and I’m ready for tough criticism! We really need your feedback to move forward in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps-web-resources-and-new-game-details&quot;&gt;Next steps: Web resources and new game details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we’re already working on bringing important new features to Dbljump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-referencing-and-external-links-with-web-resources&quot;&gt;Better referencing and external links with Web Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we’re building a new system for managing links and references, called Web Resources. Web Resources will allow us to properly cite sources for article notes, which is vital if we’re going to build a world-class reference. Web Resources will also allow us to &lt;strong&gt;add YouTube videos and trailers&lt;/strong&gt; to Dbljump articles, and to add official websites, Twitter pages, and other useful links to our articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanded-game-details&quot;&gt;Expanded game details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to expand the kinds of technical details you can add to games. You can already specify display resolution, frame rates and a few other things that help you compare each platform version. We think it’s also important to add minimum and maximum &lt;strong&gt;player counts for offline, LAN, and Internet play&lt;/strong&gt;. And we’ll add other details, like I/O options, so that Dbljump articles can provide information about &lt;strong&gt;features like VR support and motion controls&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump is a non-commercial technology project &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.dbljump.com/&quot;&gt;with a clear mission&lt;/a&gt;: to build the world’s best video game knowledge reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we can achieve our mission much faster with your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to be involved in an ambitious video game data project, you want to build some useful experience, and you have some free time, feel free to get in touch. Some of the areas we need help with include web development (Ember.js, Ruby on Rails, data), community development, and business development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the value of having a diverse team, and everyone is welcome to join in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, just reach out via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Neil Wheatley</name></author><summary type="html">We've fixed and improved many Dbljump article features and we're working on new ones, including web resources and game details.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dbljump is 6 times faster with our new API</title><link href="https://blog.dbljump.com/2021/07/16/dbljump-six-times-faster-new-api/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dbljump is 6 times faster with our new API" /><published>2021-07-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-07-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://blog.dbljump.com/2021/07/16/dbljump-six-times-faster-new-api</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.dbljump.com/2021/07/16/dbljump-six-times-faster-new-api/">&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve launched a new version of the Dbljump API, which makes switching between articles faster than before. We now have the right data platform on which to build new features you can see and use, including better article pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021/07/rails-jsonapi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.dbljump.com&quot;&gt;the Dbljump video game reference&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll notice links between articles load much, much faster. It’s all thanks to our new API!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new API is made with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; 6, whereas previously we were on Rails 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real reason for the speed boost is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonapi-serializer/jsonapi-serializer&quot;&gt;jsonapi-serializer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our API follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonapi.org/&quot;&gt;JSON:API&lt;/a&gt; specification. Previously, we used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems&quot;&gt;Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt; called Active Model Serializers (AMS) to turn database records into JSON:API. But AMS is old and mothballed, while jsonapi-serializer is around &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/netflix/fast_jsonapi#performance-comparison&quot;&gt;25 times faster&lt;/a&gt; at serializing responses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-an-api&quot;&gt;What’s an API?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API (application programming interface) is a way for people or other applications to interact with an application. When a digital service needs to be used by various apps, having an API gives those apps a simple interface to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our  API lets dbljump.com fetch articles from the database, handles user logins, processes new data before its gets saved, and other things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speed-comparison&quot;&gt;Speed comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to see the speed boost is by comparing the test suites of our old and new APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021/07/dbljump-api-test-speed-comparison.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software development, having an automated test suite is a way to make sure features stay workin over time. Adding new features or taking away old ones can unintentionally break other features. Testing flags broken features straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our old API test suite completed around 62 test assertions per second. But the new one handles 400 assertions per second. &lt;strong&gt;That’s 6.45 times faster!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-better-platform-for-building-new-features&quot;&gt;A better platform for building new features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new API has lots of other improvements too. So, it gives us a great foundation on which to build new Dbljump features you can see and use. We’ll have an update about new features soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; You can now sign up to become a Dbljump editor! You’ll need to be approved before you can start editing. The project is evolving, and some features aren’t here yet, but as an editor you can help shape them. We plan to improve support materials for editors in the coming weeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.dbljump.com/register&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; to become an editor of Dbljump!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that Dbljump will grow into &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.dbljump.com/editor-community&quot;&gt;a friendly, active community&lt;/a&gt; that works together to create the world’s best video game reference. We’d love you to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to know before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-registrations-go-through-an-approval-process&quot;&gt;All registrations go through an approval process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021/03/signup-questionnaire.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-right&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to keep the Dbljump editor community small for the time being. Partly because we’re still in alpha, or early, development. And partly because we’re still figuring out how best to look after our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up, we’ll approve or decline your registration based on the answers you give in the questionnaire part of the form. This helps us keep numbers small and make sure editors can write confidently in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To improve your chance of being accepted&lt;/strong&gt;, please answer the questions on why and how you’ll contribute to Dbljump as fully as you can. We’ll let you know by email if you’ve been successful or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alpha--early-in-development&quot;&gt;Alpha = early in development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump only just launched and we’re calling its current state an “alpha” release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means for you as an editor is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some features aren’t here yet.&lt;/strong&gt; But if you become an editor, you can have a say on which features we develop next.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The database design isn’t set in stone.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s possible that things you create will be deleted as Dbljump evolves, but we’ll do our utmost to make sure that doesn’t happen. Most likely is that some metadata or past article versions will get lost at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some features might might not work exactly as they should.&lt;/strong&gt; Tell us about bugs you encounter, so we can fix them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really want to hear about your experiences, good or bad. With your help, we’ll evolve Dbljump into a service that’s useful to read and great to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editor-support-pages-are-coming-your-questions-and-feedback-will-help-us-create-them&quot;&gt;Editor support pages are coming. Your questions and feedback will help us create them.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a lot of documentation about what to do as an editor yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your account is approved, you’ll log into your (quite-sparse-at-the-moment) dashboard and see tools for creating and editing articles about games, companies, and people. You can also upload images and add missing places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, how do you use these tools properly? We hope they’re intuitive enough, and you’re encouraged to simply try them out. But remember, this is an alpha test - and we’re going to use your feedback to evolve Dbljump editing tools so they’re just how you want them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’d like you to just give it a go! If you’re not sure what to do, or you want to request that we change or improve something, &lt;strong&gt;you can always talk to us via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or Discord&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m personally here to help in anyway I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks and months, we’re going to be creating guides for editing Dbljump - first on this blog, and then on &lt;strong&gt;a dedicated support website&lt;/strong&gt;. All of your experiences and feedback will help us create useful docs, so keep experimenting and keep talking to us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the Dbljump blog! This is our very first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid I loved computer games (as we called them in 1990s England). As a grown-up, that hasn’t changed. Why would it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming is massive today. It’s a huge market, it’s popular everywhere, and it’s inspiring all kinds of creativity. But somehow, games have stayed far outside the establishment. It’s as if the medium is still too new to be trusted. Big players in the entertainment industries still don’t understand gaming. The press is still happy to vilify them. Some critics have said games can never be art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games’ current standing reminds me of a lecture from my English degree. The lecture was about early novels. A few hundred years ago, reading novels was considered self-indulgent, a waste of time. Today, great novels are regarded as high art. That’s the journey all culture makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of novels are worthless trash; many are fantastic. The same can be said of video games. There’s no doubt in my mind that in the future, games will be held in the same regard as literature, music and cinema. It’s going to take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of us already appreciate the wonder and importance of video games. If you’re one of them, Dbljump is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dbljump-is-a-video-game-knowledge-reference&quot;&gt;Dbljump is a video game knowledge reference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Dbljump is this: &lt;strong&gt;one place on the Internet with everything you want to know about video games and the games industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020/06/person-article-mobile-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-right&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest thing we have to that now is Wikipedia. Which is amazing, of course. It has a brilliant community and content. The problem with Wikipedia is that it doesn’t have trailers and screens. It doesn’t structure data in ways you can analyse, or help you join the dots between games, people, and companies. It’s a general reference, not one dedicated to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few game databases around too. They’re like gaming versions of IMDb. But none of them has ever gained much traction because none is quite right. Some fail on presentation. Some prioritise quantity over quality, trying to catalogue every game ever created. Others are mere scrapers, which don’t add much value to the data they collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump is our answer to this problem. Our mission is to make it the best gaming reference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-features-are-in-the-dbljump-alpha-whats-coming-in-the-future&quot;&gt;Which features are in the Dbljump alpha? What’s coming in the future?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump combines &lt;strong&gt;the encyclopaedia-style content of Wikipedia with the structured data of a database&lt;/strong&gt;. And it’s our goal to present everything beautifully. (We aren’t there yet and we’d love your feedback.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re launching in an “alpha” state. That’s the stage before beta, i.e. early days. It’s functional, but it doesn’t have all the features we’re planning yet. There will definitely be bugs. Almost everything has room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At launch Dbljump editors will be able to create articles about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games&lt;/strong&gt; including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform versions&lt;/strong&gt; with technical details (e.g. frame-rate and resolution)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Releases&lt;/strong&gt; for each version with dates, places, and basic media types&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company and staff credits&lt;/strong&gt; with options to specify version and place (e.g. the publisher of the Nintendo Switch version in North America)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt; including screenshots, box arts, art, and more; you can specify a version, place, date, and add the proper attributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aliases&lt;/strong&gt; with options to specify place, kind (e.g. working titles), writing system (e.g. Japanese, Chinese, Cyrillic, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are Dbljump’s categorised, encyclopaedia-like text with references; categories for game notes include development, story, and cultural impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt; including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal details&lt;/strong&gt; like date and place of birth/death, and aliases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game credits&lt;/strong&gt; including role, place and version where appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt; including photos and artworks; as with game images, you can specify a version, place, date, and add the proper attributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; with references, so you can provide biographical detail; categories for people include biography, education, and career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies&lt;/strong&gt; including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company details&lt;/strong&gt; like locations, founding and closing dates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships&lt;/strong&gt; between organisations, past and present; so we can link divisions and subsidiaries to their parents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aliases&lt;/strong&gt; so we can chart name changes and names in different places, writing systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits&lt;/strong&gt; including role, place and version where appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt; including logos, photos, document scans and more; like with people images, you can specify a version, place, date, and add the proper attributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; with references, so you can provide historic detail; categories for companies include history, technologies, and products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to add new features including videos, game character articles, awards, and sales figures. Game platforms will become first-class articles with their own images, notes, and platform-specific data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell us which features are important via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and our Discord (opening soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-topics-are-notable-enough&quot;&gt;Which topics are notable enough?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbljump editors can create articles about &lt;strong&gt;whichever games, people and companies you want&lt;/strong&gt;. If you love 90s Sega arcades, try forming a group around that. If you want to be first to put together info and media about newly announced games, do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020/06/companies-dash-mobile-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-left&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re focused on gaming. Many games, people, and companies that aren’t notable enough for Wikipedia are welcome here. Our tools and presentation are specialised for gaming topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you love a particular gaming niche, or you’re a fan of an under-appreciated game director or company, you can use Dbljump to shine a light on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re not here to robotically input every retro game&lt;/strong&gt;. We believe the topics our community wants to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; about are likely the topics the wider audience wants to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we want you to enjoy contributing to Dbljump - this is for fun, not work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign-up is opening  soon and I’ll update this post when it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, please feel free to ask questions and let us know what you think. You can do that via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dbljumpgames&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re really excited about finally launching Dbljump. We hope you’ll support us as we work to build a gaming reference we can all enjoy and be proud of!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Neil Wheatley</name></author><summary type="html">Learn more about what's in the Dbljump video game reference at launch, and what makes it different, in our first blog post.</summary></entry></feed>
